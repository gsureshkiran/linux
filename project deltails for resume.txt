----------------------------------------------------------------
Pipeline Creation: Designed, developed, and maintained Jenkins pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to automate the build, test, and deployment processes across multiple environments (development, testing, and production).
Plugin Management: Integrated various Jenkins plugins, including Git, Maven, Docker, and Slack, to enhance pipeline capabilities and streamline the development workflow.
Automated Testing: Configured automated testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Selenium) within Jenkins pipelines to ensure code quality and reliability before deployment.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Implemented Infrastructure as Code using Jenkins and tools like Ansible and Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
Containerization: Integrated Docker with Jenkins to automate the building and deployment of containerized applications, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging for Jenkins jobs using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to track pipeline performance and troubleshoot issues.
Version Control: Managed Jenkins pipeline code as part of version control (Git), ensuring traceability and collaboration among team members.
Security: Implemented secure handling of credentials and sensitive data within Jenkins using Jenkins Credentials Plugin and best practices.
Scalability: Optimized Jenkins performance by configuring distributed builds across multiple Jenkins nodes, improving build times and system reliability.
